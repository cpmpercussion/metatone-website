I'm currently at PASIC2014 in Indianapolis to present a session on performing with iPads in percussion ensemble - here's the take home notes from my talk!

### iPad Apps

* **PhaseRings** _(New at PASIC 2014)_ - A customisable ring interface for short and sustained percussive sounds - featuring seven sound-schemes, four compositions and a generative engine for making great setups!
* **BirdsNest** - A sonic journey through a forest in northern Sweden featuring birdsong, field recordings and percussion. Premiered at PASIC 2013.
* **MetaLonsdale** - A portrait of a Canberra café in sound art using field recordings and percussive sounds.
* **Snow Music** - Perform with the sounds of snow anywhere in any season!
