There are currently four Metatone apps available for free in the iTunes App Store. While each app is a self contained musical instrument they share a touch-interface inspired by simple interactions with percussion instruments. Tap to play a short note - swipe to create a continuous sound. Each app contains a palette of sounds for creating a specific kind of soundscape, from the snow and ice in Northern Sweden to a Canberra café. Click on the app pages above for more information.

## Music

Ensemble Metatone plays improvised and experimental music using Charles Martin's iPad-instruments and percussion. Recorded live in Canberra at the ANU School of Music 2013-08-03, this concert followed a series of rehearsals-as-research where the performers thoroughly explored two iPad app-instruments through improvised performance. 

In these contemplative works, the group performs on iPads with a vocabulary of touch-gestures inspired by their percussive backgrounds and, conversely, uses acoustic percussion instruments to mimic and augment the apps' sound-palettes.
